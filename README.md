# C Programming Code

This repository contains journey of learning C programming. The code is organized by topic, starting with the basics and advancing to more complex algorithms and data structures.

## Table of Contents

1. [Basic Syntax and Concepts](01-basics)
2. [Functions](02-functions)
3. [Arrays and Strings](03-arrays)
4. [Pointers and Memory Management](04-pointers)
5. [Structures](05-structs)
6. [Algorithms](06-algorithms)
7. [Advanced Topics](07-advanced)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:

## How to Run?
1. Download & Setup any C compiler software. (Eg. [Dev C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dev-cpp/files/))
2. Open the `.c` program files with the C compiler software you have installed.

## Get Specific Code
1. Copy the c program code you want to run then paste it in your compiler and save the files as `<filename>.c`
2. Run the program.


## Error In Code?
Although, we are upload the code by running & verifying at least one time so in any case if you found some error/bug then you can fix that and contribute in our code or you can simple create the issue in our repository.
